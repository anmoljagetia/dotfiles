* Dotfiles

I really like to configure my system in every possible way so that it can be geared towards a more personalized experience. This repository holds how I do it.
The goal here is to update my machine with Betterâ„¢ system defaults, preferences, software configuration and even auto-install some handy development tools and apps.

* Installation

The easiest way to install these dotfiles is to clone the repository and then run the installer script. This will install the necessary packages, clone other dependent repositories and try and configure the system in as automated fashion as possible.

#+begin_src bash

git clone git@github.com:anmoljagetia/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh

#+end_src
