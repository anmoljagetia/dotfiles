* Dotfiles

I really like to configure my system in every possible way so that it can be used for a more personalized experience. This repository holds how I do it.
The goal here is to update my machine with betterâ„¢ system defaults, preferences, software configuration and even auto-install some handy development tools and apps.

* Installation

The easiest way to install these dotfiles is to clone the repository and then run the installer script. This will install the necessary packages, clone other dependent repositories and try and configure the system in as automated fashion as possible.

#+begin_src bash

git clone git@github.com:anmoljagetia/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh

#+end_src

** Terminal

This directory contains the custom colorschemes that I use with iterm and terminal applications. These colors are optimised for dark backgrounds and my colorschemes.

** bash

There are two major files here. =bash_profile= and =bashrc=. Since I don't use bash extensively, my bashrc is pretty basic however I use =bash_profile= to load all the folders that I need to add to system PATH and configure other environments.

** bin/external_bin

 This directory is added to path and containes lot of nice small utilities that I use frequently. The =external_bin= directory is used to store binaries that are downloaded of the internet. This is done to avoid adding them to version control and have a central place where they can be accessed and re-downloaded on any new computer. There is also a documentation available in the =external_bin= repo.

** emacs

This directory contains my =.spacemacs= and my =.spacemacs.d= directories. These personal configs will be moved to a personal layer in the future.

** functions

This is where all functions are stored. These are lazy loaded at run-time so the prompt doesn't get slow. There are a lots of them and they provide for accessing utilities that are installed on the system in a more efficient manner.

** git

This is where my =git_config= sits. It's extremely minimal and there is also a global =gitignore_global= that I use.

** hammerspoon

This is one of the most important folders in my dotfiles. Hammerspoon has transformed the way I use my mac. I have so many additonal shortcuts and customizations setup using Hammerspoon that I will have to maintain a seperate Wiki for the same.

** node

Configurations for nodejs installation.

** sublime

Configuration for Sublime Text. These are old and unmaintained since I don't use Sublime Text anymore.


** tmux

** vim

** zsh
